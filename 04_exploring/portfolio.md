That’s the right mindset 👍 — your portfolio should feel like *you*, not just another template or clone.
Here’s a **step-by-step roadmap** to help you build a unique portfolio website from scratch:

---

## 🔹 1. Define the Purpose

Before writing code, clarify:

* **Goal** → Is it to get a job, freelance clients, or just showcase projects?
* **Audience** → Recruiters, tech leads, or potential clients?
* **Message** → What do you want people to remember after visiting? (e.g., *“Harsh is a creative full-stack developer who loves solving real-world problems”*).

---

## 🔹 2. Content Planning

Sketch out the main sections:

1. **Hero Section** → A quick intro, name, role, maybe a tagline.
2. **About Me** → Your story, values, and what makes you different.
3. **Projects** → Showcase 3–5 of your best projects (quality > quantity). Add:

   * Screenshot / demo
   * Short description
   * Tech stack
   * GitHub & live link
4. **Skills** → Tools, frameworks, languages.
5. **Experience / Education** (if relevant).
6. **Contact** → Easy way to reach you (form, email, LinkedIn, GitHub).

*(Tip: Write the content in plain text first, so you’re not distracted by design.)*

## 🔹 3. Design Phase

Since you don’t want to copy:

* **Moodboard / Inspiration** → Browse [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com), [Behance](https://www.behance.net), [Mobbin](https://mobbin.com) for ideas, but don’t clone — just collect *styles* you like (colors, layouts, typography).
* **Wireframe** → Draw your layout on paper or use tools like Figma/Excalidraw.
* **Choose Your Identity** → Colors, fonts, shapes that represent *you*.
  Example: minimal + modern vs colorful + playful.

---

## 🔹 4. Tech Stack

Pick based on your current comfort + what you want to showcase:

* **Frontend only (simple, fast):** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
* **Framework (modern touch):** React, Next.js, Astro, Vue.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, CSS modules, or plain CSS.
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify (all free).

*(If you want, I can suggest a stack based on whether you want it to be static or interactive.)*

---

## 🔹 5. Development

* Start small → Build a minimal version with content & layout.
* Add interactivity gradually (animations, dark mode, etc.).
* Optimize for performance & accessibility.
* Make it responsive (mobile-first mindset).

---

## 🔹 6. Personal Touch (Make It Unique)

* Use a **personal logo** (even text-based).
* Add a **custom illustration** or 3D element (if you’re into design).
* Include a **blog/notes section** if you like teaching/sharing.
* Subtle **micro-interactions** (hover effects, animations).
* Tell your **story** — what makes you different as a dev.

---

## 🔹 7. Deployment & Feedback

* Deploy early → get a live link.
* Ask for feedback from friends/mentors.
* Refine over time (it’s never “finished”).

---

⚡ Key Tip → **Don’t over-design.** A clean, well-structured portfolio with real projects beats a flashy but empty site.
