## **🔹 What is a Router?**
A **router** is a **networking device** that connects different networks and directs (or routes) data between them. It acts as a **gateway** between your **local network (home, office)** and the **internet**.

### **🔍 Key Functions of a Router**
1. **Routes Data Packets:**  
   - It decides the **best path** for data to travel across networks.
   
2. **Assigns IP Addresses (DHCP):**  
   - The router gives devices (PCs, mobiles, smart TVs) **local IP addresses**.

3. **Connects Multiple Devices:**  
   - Allows multiple devices to share the same internet connection.

4. **Translates Private to Public IP (NAT):**  
   - Uses **Network Address Translation (NAT)** to convert private IPs to a public IP.

5. **Provides Security (Firewall & Filtering):**  
   - Blocks harmful traffic and prevents cyber attacks.

6. **Wireless & Wired Connectivity:**  
   - Supports **Wi-Fi (wireless)** and **Ethernet (wired)** connections.

### **🔹 How Does a Router Work?**
1. Your device (phone/laptop) sends a **request** to access a website (e.g., `google.com`).
2. The router **receives** the request and **forwards** it to the ISP.
3. The ISP sends the request to Google's server.
4. Google's server sends back the **webpage data**.
5. The router **delivers** the webpage to your device.

📌 **Example:** When you type `www.youtube.com`, the router sends the request to YouTube’s server and retrieves the data for you.
