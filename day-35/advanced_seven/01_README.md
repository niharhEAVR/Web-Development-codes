### What is `responseText`?

- **`responseText`** is a property of the `XMLHttpRequest` object that holds the **raw response data** as a string from the server after an HTTP request is completed. In your case, you're making a `GET` request to the GitHub API to retrieve data about a specific GitHub user, and the server responds with that data in **JSON format**.

- The value of `responseText` is only available when the `XMLHttpRequest` request has been successfully processed and the readyState is `4` (which means the request is complete).

### Why is `responseText` a string?

- HTTP communication is based on plain text. When the server sends a response back to the client (in this case, your browser), the response is a sequence of characters (text).
  
- If the response from the server is in **JSON format** (as with many APIs, including GitHub's), this JSON data will come as a string. It needs to be converted into a JavaScript object for further use.

### Example of `responseText`:

When you request data from the GitHub API for the user "Nihar-Debnath," the response might look like this as a raw JSON string:

```json
{
    "login": "Nihar-Debnath",
    "id": 123456,
    "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123456?v=4",
    "name": "Nihar Debnath",
    "followers": 5
    // Other properties
}
```

Before parsing this string with `JSON.parse()`, this is what **`responseText`** would look like:

```json
'{"login": "Nihar-Debnath", "id": 123456, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123456?v=4", "name": "Nihar Debnath", "followers": 5}'
```

This is just a **string**, so you cannot directly manipulate the data. To use it programmatically (e.g., to access `avatar_url`, `name`, or `followers`), you need to convert this string into a **JavaScript object** using `JSON.parse()`.

### What Does `this` Mean in `this.responseText`?

The **`this`** keyword, when used in the context of the `XMLHttpRequest` object's event handler (`onreadystatechange`), refers to the current instance of the `XMLHttpRequest` object.

So in your code:

```javascript
xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
        let data = JSON.parse(this.responseText); // 'this' refers to the xhr object
    }
}
```

- **`this`** refers to the `xhr` object because the function is part of `xhr.onreadystatechange`. So **`this.responseText`** means **`xhr.responseText`**.
  
- `this.responseText` is used to access the raw response data (as a string) returned from the GitHub API.

### Example Workflow of How `responseText` is Used:

1. **Request Sent**:
   - Your JavaScript code makes a `GET` request to the GitHub API using `xhr.send()`.
   
2. **Server Response**:
   - GitHub's server sends back the user data in **JSON format**, which is stored in `xhr.responseText` as a string.

3. **Check `readyState`**:
   - When the `readyState` becomes `4` (i.e., the request is completed), you access `this.responseText` (which refers to the string response).

4. **Parsing the Response**:
   - You then convert this JSON string into a JavaScript object using `JSON.parse()` so that you can work with it programmatically. This allows you to extract specific data, such as the user's `avatar_url`, `name`, and `followers`.

### Example of Using `this.responseText`:

```javascript
xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
        // 'this' refers to the xhr object here
        let jsonString = this.responseText; // Access the raw JSON string response
        let data = JSON.parse(jsonString);  // Parse the string into a JavaScript object
        console.log(data.name);             // Access the 'name' property of the parsed object
    }
};
```

### Why Use `JSON.parse()` with `responseText`?

Since `responseText` is just a string, you cannot directly access properties like `data.name` or `data.avatar_url`. That's why you use `JSON.parse()` to convert the string into a **JavaScript object**. After parsing, the response becomes a usable JavaScript object where you can easily access the values.

### Summary:

- **`responseText`** is where the raw response (as a string) is stored.
- **`this.responseText`** is used to access this response from the current `XMLHttpRequest` instance.
- You convert the string in `responseText` to a JavaScript object using `JSON.parse()` to work with it effectively.
