### What is Rate Limiting?

1. **Rate Limiting**: APIs often implement rate limiting to control the number of requests a client can make within a certain period. This helps prevent abuse of the service and ensures fair usage among all users.

2. **GitHub Rate Limits**:
   - For unauthenticated requests, GitHub limits the number of requests to **60 requests per hour** from a single IP address.
   - Authenticated requests (where you use a personal access token or OAuth token) have a higher limit of **5,000 requests per hour**.

```JSON
{
    "message":"API rate limit exceeded for 'my ip address' (But here's the good news: Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation for more details.)",
    "documentation_url":"https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting"
}
```

### Breakdown of the Error Message

- **`"API rate limit exceeded"`**: This part indicates that you've sent more requests than allowed within the time frame.
- **`for 'my ip address'`**: This specifies the IP address that has exceeded the limit.
- **`"Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit"`**: This suggests that if you authenticate your requests, you will have a higher limit, allowing you to make more requests within the same time frame.
- **`"Check out the documentation for more details"`**: A link to the GitHub API documentation is provided for further reading on rate limits.

### What Can You Do?

1. **Use Authentication**:

   - To increase your rate limit, you can authenticate your requests using a personal access token or OAuth token. Hereâ€™s how to do it with a personal access token:
     - Go to [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and create a new personal access token.
     - When making requests, include the token in the request headers:
       ```javascript
       const response = await fetch(
         "https://api.github.com/users/Nihar-Debnath",
         {
           headers: {
             Authorization: "token YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
           },
         }
       );
       ```

2. **Check the Documentation**: Refer to the [GitHub API rate limiting documentation](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting) for detailed information on how limits work and how to authenticate your requests.

3. **Wait for the Limit to Reset**: You can simply wait for the rate limit to reset (which happens on a per-hour basis). You can check your current rate limit status by using the endpoint:
   ```
   https://api.github.com/rate_limit
   ```
   and this rate limit based on my Local Machine Ip Address (computer) not individual github account

The response you received from the GitHub API regarding the rate limit provides detailed information about your current usage and limits for different resources. Let's break down the key parts of the JSON response:

}

### Key Elements Explained

1. **Core API Rate Limit (`core`)**:

   - **`limit`**: You are allowed **60 requests** per hour for unauthenticated requests.
   - **`remaining`**: You have **0 requests left** in this hour.
   - **`reset`**: The time (in UNIX epoch seconds) when the rate limit will reset. You can convert this to a readable format to find out when you can make requests again.
   - **`used`**: You have used **60 requests** in this hour.

2. **GraphQL Rate Limit (`graphql`)**:

   - **`limit`**: You have **0 requests** remaining for GraphQL queries. This indicates you either haven't made any GraphQL requests or you have hit the limit (which is typically lower).
   - **`remaining`**: **0** remaining requests for GraphQL.
   - **`reset`**: Time when the rate limit for GraphQL will reset.
   - **`used`**: You have made **0 requests**.

3. **Integration Manifest Rate Limit (`integration_manifest`)**:

   - **`limit`**: **5000 requests**.
   - **`remaining`**: You have **5000 requests** remaining.
   - **`reset`**: Time when the limit for integration manifests will reset.
   - **`used`**: You have made **0 requests**.

4. **Search Rate Limit (`search`)**:
   - **`limit`**: **10 requests** per hour for search requests.
   - **`remaining`**: You have **10 requests** remaining.
   - **`reset`**: Time when the search rate limit will reset.
   - **`used`**: You have made **0 search requests**.

### Understanding the `reset` Value

- The `reset` values are UNIX timestamps. You can convert these timestamps to a human-readable date and time to see when your rate limits will reset. For example, using JavaScript, you can convert it as follows:

```javascript
let resetTime = 1729857576; // Example reset time from the response
let resetDate = new Date(resetTime * 1000); // Convert to milliseconds
console.log(resetDate); // Logs the reset date and time
```

### What to Do Next

1. **Wait for Reset**: Since your core API limit has been reached, you will need to wait until the `reset` time (which is indicated in the response) to make more requests.

2. **Authenticate Your Requests**: To avoid hitting the rate limit so quickly, consider authenticating your requests using a personal access token. This will increase your limit to **5,000 requests per hour**.

3. **Plan Requests Wisely**: If your application relies heavily on the GitHub API, implement logic to check the rate limit before making requests to ensure you don't exceed it.

By monitoring and understanding these limits, you can make efficient use of the GitHub API and avoid interruptions in service due to rate limiting.
