The code you provided works because of how **JavaScript** and **React** handle imports, exports, and function naming. Let's break it down to explain why it works:

---

### **1. File Naming and Function Export**
- In React (or JavaScript modules), you can name the file and the default export function differently. The file name (`Greet.js`) and the function name (`greet`) do not need to match.
- The `Greet` component is imported from `Greet.js` and used in `App.js`. Here's how:

#### Greet.js:
```javascript
function greet() {
    return (
        <>
            <h1>Hello Cooldude!</h1>
        </>
    )
}

export default greet;
```

- The `greet` function is exported as the **default export**.
- This means when you import it, you can use any name for it.

#### App.js:
```javascript
import Greet from './Greet'; // 'Greet' can be any name; it's an alias for the default export from Greet.js.
```

- In this case, `Greet` is the name chosen during import, but it could just as well be named something else:
  ```javascript
  import SomethingElse from './Greet';
  ```

  Then, in your JSX:
  ```javascript
  <SomethingElse />
  ```

### **2. Why Does It Work?**
- The reason it works lies in the nature of **default exports** in JavaScript modules:
  - A default export does not care about the name of the importing variable.
  - Whatever is exported by default can be imported using any name, as long as it's the only export.
  
- In this example:
  - `greet` is exported as the default from `Greet.js`.
  - When you import it in `App.js` using `import Greet`, you're just renaming it to `Greet` for convenience.

---

### **3. React Component Naming Convention**
React follows a convention:
- **Component names must start with an uppercase letter.**
- React distinguishes between HTML tags and React components based on case:
  - `<div>` is an HTML element.
  - `<Greet>` is a React component.

Since `greet` is renamed to `Greet` during the import, React interprets it as a component when used in JSX.

---

### **What Happens Behind the Scenes?**
When you use `<Greet />` in `App.js`:
1. React recognizes `Greet` as a component.
2. It looks at the `Greet` import, which refers to the default export (`greet` function) from `Greet.js`.
3. React renders the output of the `greet` function: 
   ```html
   <h1>Hello Cooldude!</h1>
   ```

---

### **Key Takeaway**
- **File Name ≠ Function Name**: The file name (`Greet.js`) and the default-exported function name (`greet`) don’t have to match.
- **Default Exports Can Be Renamed**: You can import a default export with any name you prefer.
- **React’s Uppercase Rule**: When using the function as a component, ensure the import name starts with an uppercase letter (like `Greet`) to adhere to React’s JSX conventions.
