In JavaScript, memory management is crucial for understanding how data is stored and accessed. The two types of memory used are **Heap** and **Stack**, and they store different kinds of values. Let's break it down:

### 1. **Stack Memory (Stores Primitive Data Types)**
   - Stack memory is used for **static** storage and follows a **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle.
   - It is used to store **primitive** data types such as:
     - `Number`
     - `String`
     - `Boolean`
     - `Null`
     - `Undefined`
     - `Symbol`
     - `BigInt`
   - These values are **stored directly** in memory and accessed quickly.
   - Since primitives are immutable, whenever you assign a primitive to another variable, **a copy of the value** is created.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   let a = 10;
   let b = a; // 'b' gets a copy of 'a'
   b = 20;

   console.log(a); // 10
   console.log(b); // 20
   ```
   - `a` and `b` are stored in the stack.
   - When `b = a` is assigned, a **copy** of `a` is made.
   - Changing `b` does **not** affect `a` because they are stored separately.

---

### 2. **Heap Memory (Stores Non-Primitive Data Types)**
   - Heap memory is used for **dynamic** storage and is where complex data structures are stored.
   - It stores **non-primitive** data types such as:
     - `Objects`
     - `Arrays`
     - `Functions`
   - Unlike primitives, non-primitive types are stored **by reference** in memory.
   - When assigning an object to a variable, the **reference (memory address)** is stored in the stack, while the actual data resides in the heap.
   - If you assign an object to another variable, both variables **point to the same reference**, meaning changes to one affect the other.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   let obj1 = { name: "John" };
   let obj2 = obj1; // 'obj2' gets a reference to 'obj1'
   obj2.name = "Doe";

   console.log(obj1.name); // "Doe"
   console.log(obj2.name); // "Doe"
   ```
   - `obj1` is stored in the heap.
   - `obj2` **does not create a new object**; instead, it **points to the same reference** in memory.
   - Changing `obj2.name` also changes `obj1.name` because both refer to the same object.

### **Key Differences Between Stack and Heap**
| Feature          | Stack (Primitive Data) | Heap (Non-Primitive Data) |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Type of Storage | Static (Fixed Size)  | Dynamic (Flexible)  |
| Speed          | Faster               | Slower             |
| Stores         | Primitive values      | Objects, Arrays, Functions |
| Assignment     | Copies value          | Copies reference   |
| Mutability     | Immutable (Creates new memory on change) | Mutable (Changes affect all references) |

Understanding **Stack vs. Heap** helps in avoiding **unintended mutations** and managing **memory efficiently** in JavaScript. ðŸš€

## **1. Heap Memory for Objects**
Objects in JavaScript are stored in **heap memory**, and variables store a **reference** to that memory location.

### **Example:**
```javascript
let obj1 = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
let obj2 = obj1; // obj2 now holds a reference to the same object

obj2.age = 35; // Modifying obj2 also affects obj1

console.log(obj1.age); // Output: 35 (since obj1 and obj2 reference the same object)
console.log(obj2.age); // Output: 35
```
ðŸ‘‰ **Explanation:** Both `obj1` and `obj2` point to the same object in **heap memory**, so modifying `obj2` also updates `obj1`.

---

## **2. Heap Memory for Arrays**
Arrays also reside in the **heap memory** and are referenced by variables.

### **Example:**
```javascript
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = arr1; // arr2 holds the same reference

arr2.push(4); // Modifying arr2 also affects arr1

console.log(arr1); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] (since both arr1 and arr2 point to the same array)
console.log(arr2); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
ðŸ‘‰ **Explanation:** Since arrays are stored in the **heap**, `arr1` and `arr2` reference the **same** memory location. Changing `arr2` also updates `arr1`.

---

## **3. Heap Memory for Functions**
Functions in JavaScript are objects and are stored in the **heap memory**.

### **Example:**
```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

let sayHello = greet; // sayHello holds a reference to the function

sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, world!"
```
ðŸ‘‰ **Explanation:** The function `greet` is stored in the **heap memory**, and `sayHello` holds a reference to it.

### **Function with Objects in Heap**
```javascript
let user = {
  name: "Bob"
};

function updateUser(obj) {
  obj.name = "Charlie"; // Modifying the object
}

updateUser(user);

console.log(user.name); // Output: "Charlie"
```
ðŸ‘‰ **Explanation:** The function modifies the object in **heap memory**, so the changes persist even outside the function.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Objects, arrays, and functions are stored in the heap** while variables hold **references** to them.
2. **Modifying a referenced object or array affects all variables pointing to it.**
3. **Primitive values (numbers, strings, booleans) are stored directly in the stack**, not the heap.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. How memory works in JS

JavaScript has **two main places** for memory:

1. **Stack (short-lived things)**

   * Stores *primitives* (numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, symbols, bigints).
   * Stores *references (pointers)* to objects/arrays/functions.
   * Automatically managed, very fast.

2. **Heap (long-lived, dynamic things)**

   * Stores the actual *objects, arrays, functions*.
   * Heap is bigger and flexible.
   * Values here can grow/shrink (e.g. pushing items into an array).

Example:

```js
let x = 10;               // stored in stack
let arr = [1, 2, 3];      // reference (stack) â†’ actual array in heap
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Garbage Collection

JavaScript uses **automatic garbage collection** (mostly *mark-and-sweep algorithm*):

* The engine (like V8 in Chrome/Node.js) tracks which objects are still *reachable* (can be accessed from your code).
* If an object becomes **unreachable**, it is removed from heap automatically.

Example:

```js
let user = { name: "Alex" }; 
user = null;  
// old object {name: "Alex"} becomes unreachable â†’ garbage collected
```

So **you donâ€™t need to manually free heap memory** (like in C/C++).

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. What is Memory Leak?

A **memory leak** happens if objects remain *reachable* (referenced) but are no longer useful.
Garbage collector wonâ€™t clear them because JS thinks you still need them.

Example of leak:

```js
let cache = {};

function addData(key, value) {
  cache[key] = value; // stored forever unless cleared
}

addData("user1", { name: "Deb" });
// Even if "user1" is never used, object stays in memory
```

Or with event listeners:

```js
function attach() {
  let bigData = new Array(1000000).fill("x");
  document.body.addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log(bigData.length);
  });
}
attach();
// bigData stays in heap because the closure keeps reference
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. How to Avoid Memory Leaks

1. **Remove references you donâ€™t need**

   ```js
   user = null;
   ```

2. **Clean up event listeners**

   ```js
   element.removeEventListener("click", handler);
   ```

3. **Be careful with global variables**

   * If you assign to `window.someVar = ...`, it stays until page refresh.

4. **Use WeakMap/WeakSet** for caches

   * They allow objects to be garbage-collected automatically.

---

âœ… **Conclusion:**

* Objects, arrays, and functions live in heap.
* Garbage collection usually frees unused memory automatically.
* **Memory leaks happen only if you accidentally keep references alive** (like global variables, event listeners, closures).
* You donâ€™t need `delete` like in C, but you should design code so unnecessary references get dropped.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. JavaScript has its own Garbage Collector (GC)

* JavaScript engines (like **V8 in Chrome/Node.js**, **SpiderMonkey in Firefox**, etc.) include a **garbage collector**.
* Its job is to **automatically free memory** from the heap when objects/arrays/functions are **no longer reachable** in your program.
* You donâ€™t need to manually call `free()` or `delete` like in C/C++.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. When does GC run?

* It doesnâ€™t wait until the **entire program ends**.
* The garbage collector runs **periodically during execution**.
* It looks for objects that canâ€™t be reached anymore from the "root" (global scope, currently running functions, closures, etc.).

This is called **reachability**:

* If something can still be reached â†’ memory is kept.
* If something is unreachable â†’ memory is released.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Example

```js
function test() {
  let user = { name: "Alice" };
  console.log(user.name);
}

test();
// After test() finishes, "user" goes out of scope
// object {name: "Alice"} is unreachable -> GC clears it automatically
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Important Point

Garbage collection is **not immediate** and **not predictable**:

* You canâ€™t force it to run at a specific time.
* The engine decides when itâ€™s best to free memory (to avoid performance drops).

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Memory Leak Problem

Even with GC, memory leaks can happen if:

* You keep unnecessary references alive.
* Example:

  ```js
  let cache = {};
  function store() {
    cache["data"] = new Array(1000000).fill("x"); 
  }
  store();
  // Even if not used, "cache" keeps the array alive -> GC won't delete it
  ```

So GC can only clean up memory thatâ€™s truly unreachable.

---

âœ… **Conclusion:**
Yes, JavaScript has a **built-in garbage collector** that clears heap memory automatically during execution. You donâ€™t need to do manual memory management, but you **must avoid keeping useless references alive**, or memory leaks will still happen.
