# ðŸ”¹ 1. What is `Date.now()`?

* `Date.now()` is a **static method** of the `Date` object in JavaScript.
* It returns the **current timestamp** in **milliseconds** since the **Unix Epoch**.

```js
let myTimeStamps = Date.now();
console.log(myTimeStamps); 
// Example output: 1726916752356
```

# ðŸ”¹ 2. What is a Timestamp?

A **timestamp** is just a big number representing a point in time.
Instead of storing "21st September 2025, 1:20 PM", we store:

ðŸ‘‰ **milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC** (the Unix Epoch).

Why? Because:

* Numbers are easier to store/compare than text dates.
* You can do math easily:

  ```js
  let start = Date.now();
  // ... some code ...
  let end = Date.now();
  console.log(`Execution time: ${end - start} ms`);
  ```

# ðŸ”¹ 3. Why "1970-01-01 UTC"? (History)

This comes from **Unix time**, introduced in the **late 1960s** for Unix operating systems.

* Unix designers needed a **universal zero-point** in time.
* They chose **January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC** because:

  1. Unix development started around that time.
  2. Easy to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.
  3. Convenient for operating systems to track time as "seconds since epoch".

So:

* Unix time â†’ counts **seconds since epoch**.
* JavaScript (created in 1995) â†’ uses **milliseconds since epoch** (higher resolution).

---

# ðŸ”¹ 4. How JS Handles It

* Internally, JS stores time as a **number (double precision floating point)**.
* `Date.now()` is basically:

  ```js
  new Date().getTime();
  ```
* Example:

  ```
  Date.now()  â†’ 1726916752356  (milliseconds)
  Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) â†’ 1726916752  (seconds, like Unix time)
  ```

---

# ðŸ”¹ 5. Fun Facts

1. **Y2K38 problem**:

   * In systems that use 32-bit signed integers for seconds since epoch, time will overflow on **19 Jan 2038**.
   * JS doesnâ€™t have this issue because it uses 64-bit floating-point numbers.

2. **Performance timing**:

   * `Date.now()` is not the most precise for measuring small intervals.
   * For benchmarking, JS has `performance.now()` (gives microseconds, relative to page load).

---

# ðŸ”¹ 6. Use Cases

* Logging events with timestamps.
* Measuring execution time.
* Scheduling tasks.
* Generating unique IDs (when combined with randomness).

Example:

```js
let id = "user-" + Date.now();
console.log(id); // user-1726916752356
```

---

âœ… **Summary**:

* `Date.now()` â†’ milliseconds since **Unix Epoch (1970-01-01 UTC)**.
* History comes from Unix time, chosen in the 1970s.
* Itâ€™s useful for measuring time, logging, and unique IDs.
