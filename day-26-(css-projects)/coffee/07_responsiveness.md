Great question 👍 You’ve added a **media query** — that’s CSS code which only runs when the screen is small (in this case **768px or less** → tablet & mobile screens).

This block is basically making your whole site **responsive**, meaning it looks good on both big screens (desktop) and small screens (phones/tablets).

---

## 🔹 Breaking it down

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
```

* This means: “Apply these styles **only if the device width ≤ 768px**”.
* On desktop (width > 768px) → normal styles apply.
* On mobile/tablet (width ≤ 768px) → these overrides kick in.

---

### 1. Smaller main headings

```css
.main-headings .primary-headings {
    font-size: 2.5rem;
}
```

* Makes big titles **shrink down** so they fit on smaller screens.

---

### 2. Our Story section

```css
#our-story {
    text-align: center;
}
#our-story .title {
    transform: translateX(50px);
}
```

* Centers text in the "Our Story" section.
* Moves the title slightly right (`translateX(50px)`), probably for better alignment on smaller screens.

---

### 3. Content section

```css
.content-section {
    text-align: center;
}
```

* Centers text so it looks neat on narrow screens.

---

### 4. Image in Our Story

```css
#our-story .img-container .img {
    width: 70%;
    text-align: center;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```

* Makes the story image smaller (`70% width`) and centers it (`margin: 0 auto;`).
* Prevents it from being too wide for small screens.

---

### 5. Coffee container images

```css
.coffee-container .img-container {
    margin-top: 5rem;
    width: 40%;
}
```

* Adds space above coffee images and makes them narrower (`40%`).
* Keeps them balanced when stacked on mobile.

---

### 6. Titles (re-centering)

```css
.title, .title-two {
    margin: 0 auto;
}
.title-three {
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 100px;
}
```

* Forces titles to **stay centered** instead of floating left/right.
* Adds spacing below them so text/cards don’t look squished.

---

## ✅ In simple words

This media query is making sure your website doesn’t **break or look weird** on smaller screens.

* Text gets smaller.
* Images shrink and move to the center.
* Titles are centered.
* Layouts adjust (like stacking instead of side-by-side).

👉 Without this, your site might look **too big, stretched, or messy** on phones.
