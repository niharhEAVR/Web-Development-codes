In JavaScript, strings are indeed **immutable**, which means that once a string is created, its characters cannot be modified individually. However, you can create **a new string** by using string methods like `.replace()`.

Here’s what happens in your example:

```javascript
let b = "BANANA";
b = b.replace("BA", "69");
console.log(b); // Outputs: "69NANA"
```

### Explanation
- **`b.replace("BA", "69")`**: This method creates a **new string** with the specified replacement (changing `"BA"` to `"69"`), rather than modifying `b` in place.
- **`b =`**: The new string returned by `.replace()` is then assigned back to `b`, effectively replacing the old value of `b` with this new string.

### Immutability and Reassignment
While the original `"BANANA"` string itself isn’t changed, we’re reassigning `b` to hold the new modified string `"69NANA"`. This doesn’t alter the original string in memory, it just points `b` to a new string. So, immutability holds true here, but reassignment allows us to work with a modified version.
