### 1. **V8 Engine**
   - **V8** is Google’s JavaScript engine, used in environments like **Google Chrome** and **Node.js**.
   - In standard applications (e.g., Chrome’s JavaScript runtime or Node.js), V8’s internal debugging commands, like `%DebugPrint`, are **not exposed** to users.
   - These internal commands are used for development, debugging, and optimizing V8 itself, not for general-purpose JavaScript development.

### 2. **d8 (Developer Shell for V8)**
   - **d8** is a standalone **command-line shell** included with V8, primarily for testing, debugging, and inspecting V8’s internals.
   - When you run JavaScript code in **d8**, you can use internal commands like `%DebugPrint`, `%HeapObjectVerify`, and other special V8-only commands that aren’t available in standard JavaScript environments.
   - To access `%DebugPrint`, you would need to:
     1. Install **d8** (usually built alongside V8 or downloaded with a debug-enabled V8 build).
     2. Run your JavaScript code within d8 to see output from `%DebugPrint` and other low-level V8 internals.

### 3. **v8-debug (Debugging Builds of V8)**
   - **v8-debug** refers to special builds of V8 that include **debugging symbols and tools**.
   - This variant is often used by V8 developers and those needing low-level access to the engine’s internals.
   - While **d8** is the actual tool you use to execute and inspect JavaScript, **v8-debug** simply refers to a debugging-enabled version of V8, which you can run in **d8** to access enhanced debugging capabilities.

In summary:
- `%DebugPrint` and similar commands are **V8-specific internal commands**.
- You access `%DebugPrint` by running code in **d8**, which is V8’s developer shell.
- **v8-debug** isn’t a tool itself but a version of V8 with debugging features enabled, often used with **d8** for in-depth engine inspection. 

This setup is mainly for V8 developers or advanced users who need to inspect V8’s internals directly.
