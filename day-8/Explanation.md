**Lazy Loading** in HTML refers to the technique where content (like images, videos, or other elements) is only loaded when it's about to be displayed in the viewport. This can improve the page load time, especially for pages with a lot of media. It defers the loading of non-essential resources until they are actually needed. In HTML, lazy loading for images can be achieved by adding the `loading="lazy"` attribute to the `img` tag:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Description of image">
```

This way, the image will only be loaded when it comes into view as the user scrolls down the page.

**Linking in HTML** refers to the process of creating connections to other pages or resources. The primary method to link to another page or resource is by using the `<a>` (anchor) tag, where the `href` attribute specifies the destination:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example</a>
```

For internal linking within the same page or site, you can link to specific sections using the `#` symbol followed by an ID:

```html
<a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>
```

Then, in the page, you'd have a matching element with that ID:

```html
<div id="section1">Content of Section 1</div>
```

This will scroll the page to the specified section.

To embed a YouTube video in an HTML page using an `<iframe>`, you can use the following code snippet:

```html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

### Explanation of the attributes:

1. **`width`** and **`height`**: These specify the dimensions of the embedded video player. In the example above, the video is 560px wide and 315px tall.

2. **`src`**: This specifies the URL of the embedded content. To embed a YouTube video, the URL should have the format `https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID`, where `VIDEO_ID` is the unique ID for the YouTube video.

3. **`frameborder`**: This defines whether or not the iframe will have a border. `frameborder="0"` means no border.

4. **`allow`**: This attribute specifies what features the embedded content can use. The values here enable features like:
   - **`accelerometer`**: Allows the use of device orientation.
   - **`autoplay`**: Allows the video to autoplay.
   - **`clipboard-write`**: Allows writing to the clipboard.
   - **`encrypted-media`**: Allows encrypted media playback.
   - **`gyroscope`**: Allows the use of the device's gyroscope.
   - **`picture-in-picture`**: Enables the picture-in-picture mode for video.
   
5. **`allowfullscreen`**: This allows the embedded video to be viewed in fullscreen mode. Without this, the fullscreen option may not be available.

6. **`frameborder="0"`**: Ensures that no border appears around the iframe.

Make sure to replace `VIDEO_ID` with the actual ID of the YouTube video you want to embed. You can find this ID in the URL of the YouTube video, typically after `v=`, like `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`.

The `<iframe>` code you provided is embedding a YouTube video in your HTML page and it has a few parameters to control its behavior. Let's break it down:

```html
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h7MYJghRWt0?autoplay=1&mute=1" width="900px" height="500px"></iframe>
```

### Explanation:

1. **`src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h7MYJghRWt0?autoplay=1&mute=1"`**:
   - **`https://www.youtube.com/embed/h7MYJghRWt0`**: This is the URL for embedding a specific YouTube video, identified by the video ID `h7MYJghRWt0`.
   - **`?autoplay=1`**: This query parameter ensures that the video will start playing automatically as soon as the iframe is loaded.
   - **`&mute=1`**: This query parameter ensures that the video is muted when it starts playing. It's particularly useful if you want to avoid autoplaying audio unexpectedly.

2. **`width="900px"`**: This specifies the width of the embedded video player. In this case, it is set to 900 pixels.

3. **`height="500px"`**: This specifies the height of the embedded video player. In this case, it is set to 500 pixels.

### What this does:
When the page loads, an embedded YouTube video will appear with the video ID `h7MYJghRWt0`, and it will automatically start playing in a muted state. The player will have a width of 900px and a height of 500px.
