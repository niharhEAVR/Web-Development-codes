# 🎯 How Positioning Works in `<canvas>`

## 🧱 Coordinate System (Very Important!)

The canvas uses a **2D coordinate system**:

```
     (0,0) origin → top-left corner of canvas
         +------------------------> x (right)
         |
         |
         v
         y (down)
```

---

## 📌 So:

* **(0, 0)** is the top-left of the canvas
* **X increases → to the right**
* **Y increases ↓ down the screen**

## 📐 Important Notes

### 🔹 The canvas itself is positioned using **HTML layout**, but all drawing happens **inside the canvas using coordinates**.

So, if your canvas is:

```html
<canvas width="400" height="300"></canvas>
```

You can only draw between:

* X = `0` to `400`
* Y = `0` to `300`

Anything beyond this will be **cut off / not visible**.

---

## ✅ Example 1: Drawing a rectangle

```js
ctx.fillRect(10, 20, 100, 50);
```

| Parameter | Value | Meaning                            |
| --------- | ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| `x`       | `10`  | Move 10px **right** from left edge |
| `y`       | `20`  | Move 20px **down** from top edge   |
| `width`   | `100` | Rectangle width is 100px           |
| `height`  | `50`  | Rectangle height is 50px           |

📦 This will draw a rectangle starting from point (10, 20).

---

## ✅ Example 2: Drawing a circle

In HTML Canvas, **circles** are drawn using the `arc()` method on the canvas's **2D rendering context**. The key idea is that a circle is just a special case of an arc that covers a full angle of 360 degrees or $2\pi$ radians.


### ✅ Basic Syntax of `arc()`:

```javascript
context.arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, counterclockwise);
```

### 🔍 Meaning of the Parameters:

| Parameter          | Meaning                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x`                | X-coordinate of the **center** of the circle                                       |
| `y`                | Y-coordinate of the **center** of the circle                                       |
| `radius`           | Radius of the circle                                                               |
| `startAngle`       | Where to start the arc (in **radians**)                                            |
| `endAngle`         | Where to end the arc (in **radians**)                                              |
| `counterclockwise` | Direction of the drawing: `false` = clockwise (default), `true` = counterclockwise |

---

### ✅ To draw a full circle:

We just set the angle from `0` to `2 * Math.PI`.

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

ctx.beginPath();  
ctx.arc(100, 75, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);  // Circle with center (100,75) and radius 50
ctx.stroke();
```

---

### 📌 Positioning the Circle:

The `x` and `y` values are relative to the **top-left corner of the canvas**, which is coordinate **(0, 0)**.

```
(x, y) = center of the circle
radius = how far the edge is from the center
```

So, for:

```javascript
ctx.arc(100, 75, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
```

* Center is at (100, 75)
* Radius = 50
* Circle spans from 0 to 2π radians (full circle)

This means the circle will:

* Start drawing at point (150, 75) → which is to the **right** of center by 50 units (since 0 radians is the direction of the positive X-axis)
* Sweep a full 360° around the center.

### 🧠 Summary:

* Use `ctx.arc(x, y, r, 0, 2 * Math.PI)` for a full circle.
* The position `(x, y)` is the **center**.
* All angles in canvas are in **radians**, not degrees.
* Canvas coordinates start from the **top-left corner** of the canvas.
* You can check if a point is inside the circle using the **distance formula**.

## ✅ How Mouse Click Coordinates Are Calculated?

Great! Now that you understand how circle and rectangle **positions are calculated manually**, let's move to the **next step: drawing them interactively with the mouse**, just like **Excalidraw** or any simple drawing tool.

---

## 🖱️ Draw Rectangle or Circle with Mouse (like Excalidraw)

We’ll build a simple version of that:

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Overview:

1. **Mouse Down**: User starts drawing (remember the start coordinates).
2. **Mouse Move**: Show the shape as the mouse moves (live preview).
3. **Mouse Up**: Finalize the shape (draw it permanently).

---

### 🧱 HTML + Canvas:

```html
<canvas id="canvas" width="600" height="400" style="border:1px solid black;"></canvas>
```

---

### 🧠 JavaScript for Rectangle and Circle Drawing:

```javascript
var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
        var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");


        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.moveTo(50, 50);
        ctx.lineTo(51, 51);
        ctx.stroke();



        let isDrawing = false;
        let startX, startY;
        let shape = "circle"; // Can be "circle" or "rectangle"

        canvas.addEventListener("mousedown", (e) => {
            isDrawing = true;
            startX = e.offsetX;
            startY = e.offsetY;

            // shape = Math.random() >= 0.5 ? "circle" : "rectangle";
            console.log("started drawing of " + shape + " at position: " + startX + " , " + startY);
        });


        let currentX, currentY;

        canvas.addEventListener("mousemove", (e) => {
            if (!isDrawing) return;

            currentX = e.offsetX;
            currentY = e.offsetY;

            // Live preview
            ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); // clear previous shape

            if (shape === "rectangle") {
                const width = currentX - startX;
                const height = currentY - startY;
                ctx.strokeRect(startX, startY, width, height);
            } else if (shape === "circle") {
                const dx = currentX - startX;
                const dy = currentY - startY;
                console.log(dx + " + " + dy + " = " + (dx + dy));

                console.log(dx * dx + dy * dy);
                
                const radius = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
                console.log(radius);
                

                ctx.beginPath();
                ctx.arc(startX, startY, radius, 0, Math.PI * 2);
                ctx.stroke();
            }
        });

        canvas.addEventListener("mouseup", () => {
            console.log("drawing stopped: " + currentX + " , " + currentY);
            isDrawing = false;
        });

```

---

### 📌 How It Works:

* `mousedown` → Store start position (startX, startY)
* `mousemove` → Live preview using current mouse (drag) position
* `mouseup` → Finalize the shape

---
---
---



## ✏️ Scenario

Imagine you **press the mouse at point A** and **drag it to point B**:

* **A** = (`startX`, `startY`) → where the mouse was first clicked
* **B** = (`currentX`, `currentY`) → current position of the mouse during dragging

---

## 🔍 Code Breakdown

### Step 1: Get the distance between A and B

```js
const dx = currentX - startX;
const dy = currentY - startY;
```

This gives the **horizontal (dx)** and **vertical (dy)** distances from the start point to current mouse position.

🧠 Imagine:

```
A (startX, startY)
          ●
           \
            \   ← this line is the radius (mouse dragged to here)
             \
              ● B (currentX, currentY)
```

---

### Step 2: Use Pythagoras theorem to get the radius

```js
const radius = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
```

This calculates the **distance between point A and B**, which becomes the **radius** of your circle.

📐 This is classic geometry:

```
radius = √(dx² + dy²)
```

You log it here for debugging:

```js
console.log(dx + " + " + dy + " = " + (dx + dy));
console.log(dx * dx + dy * dy);
console.log(radius);
```

---

### Step 3: Draw the circle

```js
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(startX, startY, radius, 0, Math.PI * 2);
ctx.stroke();
```

This draws a **full circle (0 to 2π radians)**:

* Center: `startX`, `startY`
* Radius: calculated above

---

### 🔵 So what’s actually happening?

As you drag your mouse:

1. You define a center (`startX`, `startY`)
2. You stretch outward to (`currentX`, `currentY`)
3. That stretching distance becomes the radius
4. A circle is drawn from the center using that radius

---

### 🧪 Example:

Let’s say:

* `startX = 100`, `startY = 100`
* `currentX = 140`, `currentY = 130`

Then:

```js
dx = 140 - 100 = 40
dy = 130 - 100 = 30

radius = √(40² + 30²) = √(1600 + 900) = √2500 = 50
```

So the circle will be:

* Centered at (100, 100)
* Radius = 50
* Circle extends 50 units in all directions

---
---
---





```js
ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
```

is **very important** when you're building **live-drawing previews**, like drawing a circle or rectangle while moving the mouse.

---

### 🔍 What does this line do?

It **clears the entire canvas**—like wiping the board clean before each new frame is drawn.

```js
clearRect(x, y, width, height)
```

* Clears a rectangle area on the canvas.
* `ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)` clears **the entire canvas**.

---

### 🖼️ Why is it needed?

When you're drawing **dynamic/interactive shapes** (like mouse-based previews), the canvas doesn't automatically remove the old shapes. It just **keeps stacking new drawings on top**.

So if you **don't clear the canvas**, here's what happens:

#### ❌ Without `clearRect()`:

* Every time the mouse moves, a **new circle/rectangle** gets drawn.
* The **old shape stays there**, and the new one is drawn on top.
* This leads to:

  * **Visual clutter**
  * **Trails** or **smearing** effects
  * **Laggy or broken preview**

#### ✅ With `clearRect()`:

* Each frame is drawn **fresh**, so only the **latest version of the shape** appears.
* Looks like a **real-time live preview** of the shape you're drawing.
* Clean and responsive visuals.

---

### 🎨 Visual Example:

Without `clearRect()` (messy):

```
⭕⭕

⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛⬜  ← multiple rectangles or circles remain on canvas
```

With `clearRect()` (clean):

```
⭕     ← only current circle visible, rest wiped out
⬛     ← only current rectangle visible
```

---

### 💡 In Summary:

| Without `ctx.clearRect()`        | With `ctx.clearRect()`          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Old shapes stay on canvas        | Only the current shape is shown |
| Leaves messy trails              | Looks like a live preview       |
| Not suitable for dynamic drawing | Perfect for interactive tools   |

---

### 🧠 The Core Concept

The **HTML5 `<canvas>` element** is like a **paint surface**, and its `2D rendering context` (`ctx`) is a set of **drawing commands** that **directly modify pixels**.

> The canvas does **not remember any objects** (like circles, rectangles, lines). It only knows pixels.

---

### ⚙️ Internally, what happens when you draw?

When you call something like:

```js
ctx.arc(...);
ctx.stroke();
```

➡ This **calculates pixels** based on your command and **burns them into the canvas pixel buffer**.

Once pixels are placed:

* **They stay there.**
* Canvas has **no memory** of "what shape" that was.
* Canvas is **not like SVG or DOM**, where elements are objects you can remove later.

---

### 📌 Why shapes "stack" without `clearRect`

When you drag the mouse and draw on `mousemove`, like this:

```js
canvas.addEventListener("mousemove", () => {
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(...);
  ctx.stroke();
});
```

* You draw a **new circle** on top of the old one **every time** the mouse moves.
* The **previous drawing remains** because canvas does not remove or update existing drawings.
* So all those circle pixels **accumulate**, like layering paint.

---

### 🧽 What `ctx.clearRect()` does internally

When you run:

```js
ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
```

You're telling the canvas engine to:

> "Set all the pixel data in this area to transparent black (RGBA = 0,0,0,0)."

In other words:

* It **resets the pixel buffer** in that area.
* No shapes, no strokes, no fills—**clean slate**.

Then your new shape draws onto the empty canvas.

---

### 🎨 Summary Table

| Concept                | What Internally Happens                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ctx.stroke()`         | Updates pixels where the shape's outline lies      |
| Drawing multiple times | Layers more pixels, no shape memory                |
| `ctx.clearRect()`      | Resets specified pixels to transparent (cleared)   |
| Why shapes remain      | Because canvas doesn’t auto-clear or track objects |


### 🧠 Analogy:

Canvas is like **MS Paint**:

* You draw, and it paints pixels.
* There’s no concept of “objects”.
* If you want to undo or update something, you **manually erase** and redraw.

## 📌 Visual Example (ASCII Canvas)

```
Canvas: 300x200
Each cell = 50px x 50px

(0,0)     (50,0)    (100,0)   ...
  +---------+---------+---------+
  |         |         |         |
  |         |         |         |
  +---------+---------+---------+
(0,50)    (50,50)   (100,50)

(50,50) is 50px from left and 50px from top
```
